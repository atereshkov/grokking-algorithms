This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing algorithms described in **Grokking Algorithms** book, with the goal of enhancing my problem-solving skills and refreshing my memory from Uni times.

## About the Book
Aditya Y. Bhargava has created a comprehensive and approachable guide to understanding algorithms, making it an excellent resource for programmers. The book stands out in its ability to elucidate complex ideas using simple language, enabling readers to easily grasp the underlying principles of each algorithm.

I highly recommend **Grokking Algorithms** to programmers who wish to improve their algorithmic knowledge. In my opinion, this book is particularly beneficial for beginners, as it provides a gentle introduction to algorithms while covering a broad range of fundamental concepts. However, even experienced individuals can find value in this book as it serves as an excellent refresher, helping solidify their understanding of algorithms.

I particularly appreciate the inclusion of exercises throughout the book, as they provide practical opportunities to apply the concepts learned. These exercises challenge you to think critically and develop your problem-solving abilities. By working through them and implementing the algorithms in this repository using Swift, I wanted to reinforce my understanding and gain hands-on experience.
